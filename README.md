# image-compression
Used KMeans Clustering algorithm to reduce the size of an Image by reducing the number of possibe color combinations
 Used scikit-learn, scikit-image and python to implement the code for kmeans clustering algorithm
 Used jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values
of reduced number of possible color combinations using a slider
